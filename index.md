I'm [@semoles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/semoles/){:target="_blank" .border-b}, a software engineer who loves research, design, and writing.

<br>

I have 4+ years of [experience](/resume){: .border-b} building software solutions using web and AI technologies. I like to own outcomes through product thinking, problem-solving, stakeholder collaboration, and business-driven decision making.

<br>

I also [write](/journal){: .border-b} about what I’ve learned and the problems I’ve solved.
