## [#](#intro-amazon-s3){: #intro-amazon-s3} Intro to Amazon S3

I've been working on the [recipes project](https://github.com/sebasmoles/recipes-web-app){:target="\_blank"} for the past few weeks, and it has been an opportunity to go deeper into Vue.js and other related technologies.

I find myself facing a technology I knew I would eventually encounter: [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/){:target="\_blank"}.

In order to store the images uploaded by users from the client and retrieve them later for display, I needed a reliable storage service. After research, I discovered that [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/){:target="\_blank"} is one of the best options available in terms of quality and price.

## [#](#cors){: #cors } CORS

Yesterday, I faced a [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing){:target="\_blank"} (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) related issue. I got this error:

![CORS ScreenShot](assets/images/december-2021/Screen_Shot_2022-01-03_at_7.26.14_PM.png)

I was unsure whether it was a backend or frontend problem. It turns out, this is a fairly common error faced by many new web developers.

The solution lies in configuring your server. You need to specify the origins (clients) that should be permitted. There's a handy Node.js package called [cors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors){:target="\_blank"} that simplifies the process. Just follow the instructions in the official documentation to install it.

Welcome to backend!

## [#](#getting-started-node-js){: #getting-started-node-js } Getting started with Node.js

I started to learn [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/){:target="\_blank"} this week. Here are some definitions/ideas that I consider key: (Defined in my own words)

-   Node.js is not a language; it is a JavaScript [runtime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_system){:target="\_blank"}.
-   [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/){:target="\_blank"} stands for “Node Package Manager”. You get it by default when you download node.
-   Modules (aka libraries) are just JavaScript files that have an export.
-   `__dirname` and `__filename` are always-available variables within every module.
-   Middleware functions are modules that allow code abstraction for callbacks and validations.
-   Callbacks are functions that are passed in as arguments to other functions and are executed at a specific time. Any function can become a callback.

Some additional useful tips:

-   The [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon){:target="\_blank"} dependency is a practical tool for updating the changes we make in our code without restarting the server.
-   This is a complementary read about the web browser rendering process: [link](https://medium.com/jspoint/how-the-browser-renders-a-web-page-dom-cssom-and-rendering-df10531c9969){:target="\_blank"}.
